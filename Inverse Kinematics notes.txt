Inverse Kinematics initial implementation notes

robot constants from datasheet needed here:
- track width W = 0.381 m
- wheel radius r = 0.0975 m
- max speed vmax = 1.2 m/s

webots documentation is clear that wheel speeds are controlled using rad/s

step 1: inverse kinematics formulas
- input desired linear speed v and angular speed w
- output required linear speed of each wheel vl and vr

vl = v - [(w * 0.381)/2]

vr = v + [(w * 0.381)/2)

step 2: convert wheel speed to angular speed
- need angular speed w_motor from v_wheel

w_motor = v_wheel/0.0975
i.e. linear wheel speed / wheel radius
