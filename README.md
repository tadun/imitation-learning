# imitation_learning
We aim to enable a student Pioneer 3-DX robot to imitate the motion of a teacher Pioneer 3-DX in a Webots obstacle course using only the student's onboard monocular camera. The learner does not get access to the teacher's ground-truth pose, odometry, or control commands. 

Built for Webots 2025a on bot MacOS and Windows.
