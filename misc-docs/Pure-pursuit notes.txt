Pure Pursuit implementation notes

inputs required:
- velocity v (from PID speed controller)
- path points list (list of predicted teacher (x, y) coordinates)

Constant:
- look-ahead distance (how far ahead is the robot aiming to join the teacher's path?)

step 1: find goal point
- goal point is the point on predicted teacher path that is closest to L_d distance away from student
- iterate through teacher path points list of (x, y) coordinates
- calculate distance to point: dist = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
- calculate difference: diff = abs(dist - L_d)
- find and return (x, y) with smallest above difference in teacher path points list using this method

step 2: calculate angular velocity (formula taken from Pure Pursuit Paper)
- calculate curvature (kappa) needed to reach the target point
    - kappa = (2 * y_point) / (L_d^2)
    - y_point is the lateral deviation (left/right distance) from the goal point

- calculate desired angular velocity
    - w scales with linear velocity v
    - w = v * curvature

- return w
